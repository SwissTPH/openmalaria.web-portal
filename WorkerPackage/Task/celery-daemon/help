Copy celeryd file to /etc/init.d/

Make it executable
    chmod a+x /etc/init.d/celeryd

Copy celeryd-config to /etc/default/ and rename it celeryd
MAKE SURE THERE IS NO BLANK LINE BETWEEN PARAMETERS IN THIS FILE !!!

if any errors when trying to run the service, change the celeryd script with a one found at https://github.com/celery/celery/tree/3.0/extra and for the right linux distrib.
Also try direclty wget the celeryd file to the server.
