Hello,

You're receiving this e-mail because you requested that your OpenMalaria web portal password be reset. If this was done in error, you may disregard this message and continue using your current password.

If you did intend on changing your password, please go to the following page and choose a new password:
    {% block reset_link %}
        {{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url django.contrib.auth.views.password_reset_confirm uidb36=uid token=token %}
    {% endblock %}
NOTE: This link will become invalid if you request your password again, or successfully log in using your old password.

Thank you for using our site,

The Notre Dame OpenMalaria web portal team.
